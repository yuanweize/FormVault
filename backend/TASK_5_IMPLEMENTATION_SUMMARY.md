# Task 5: Secure File Upload System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive secure file upload system for the FormVault Insurance Portal with the following components:

## 1. Secure File Storage Service (`app/services/file_storage.py`)

### Key Features:
- **File Validation**: Type, size, and malware scanning
- **Encrypted Filenames**: Uses Fernet encryption to secure stored filenames
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification
- **Secure Storage**: Proper file permissions and organized directory structure
- **Malware Detection**: Basic pattern matching for suspicious content

### Security Measures:
- File signature validation (magic number checking)
- Content type verification against file headers
- Suspicious pattern detection (script tags, executable code)
- Encrypted filename storage to prevent directory traversal
- Secure file permissions (640 for files, 600 for encryption keys)

## 2. File Service (`app/services/file_service.py`)

### Functionality:
- **Database Integration**: Manages file metadata in database
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks all file operations with IP and user agent
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with cleanup
- **File Management**: Upload, retrieve, list, delete operations
- **Integrity Verification**: File hash validation

### Database Operations:
- Creates File records with metadata
- Associates files with applications
- Handles foreign key constraints
- Provides transaction safety with rollback

## 3. Updated File Upload API (`app/api/v1/endpoints/files.py`)

### Enhanced Endpoints:
- **POST /api/files/upload**: Secure multipart file upload
- **GET /api/files/**: List files with filtering and pagination
- **GET /api/files/{id}**: Get file metadata
- **GET /api/files/{id}/download**: Secure file download
- **DELETE /api/files/{id}**: File deletion with audit trail
- **POST /api/files/{id}/verify**: File integrity verification
- **GET /api/files/validation/rules**: Get validation parameters

### Features:
- Multipart form support for file uploads
- Optional application association
- Request context for audit logging
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- File streaming for downloads

## 4. Exception Handling (`app/core/exceptions.py`)

### Added Exception:
- **MalwareDetectedException**: For suspicious file content detection

## 5. Comprehensive Testing

### Test Coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: File storage validation, encryption, integrity
- **Service Tests**: Database operations, error handling, audit logging
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with real file operations
- **Security Tests**: Malware detection, signature validation, size limits

### Test Files Created:
- `tests/test_file_storage.py`: 21 test cases for storage functionality
- `tests/test_file_service.py`: 20+ test cases for service operations
- `tests/test_files_api_integration.py`: End-to-end API testing
- `test_file_upload_simple.py`: Basic functionality verification

## 6. Security Features Implemented

### File Validation:
- ✅ File size limits (configurable, default 5MB)
- ✅ MIME type validation against whitelist
- ✅ File extension validation
- ✅ File signature verification (magic numbers)
- ✅ Malware pattern detection

### Secure Storage:
- ✅ Encrypted filename generation using Fernet
- ✅ Secure file permissions (640 for files)
- ✅ Protected encryption key storage (600 permissions)
- ✅ SHA-256 file integrity hashing
- ✅ Organized directory structure

### Access Control:
- ✅ Application association validation
- ✅ File ownership verification
- ✅ Audit logging with IP tracking
- ✅ Request context preservation

## 7. Configuration

### Settings Added:
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: Maximum file size (5MB default)
- `ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES`: Whitelist of MIME types
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: Secure upload directory location

### Dependencies:
- `cryptography`: For file encryption and security
- `python-multipart`: For multipart form handling
- All existing FastAPI and SQLAlchemy dependencies

## 8. Database Schema

### File Model Features:
- Unique file IDs (UUID)
- Application association (foreign key)
- File type classification (student_id, passport)
- Original and encrypted filename storage
- File size and MIME type tracking
- SHA-256 hash for integrity
- Upload IP address logging
- Timestamp tracking
- Proper indexes for performance

## 9. API Response Examples

### Successful Upload:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "file_type": "student_id",
  "original_filename": "student_id.jpg",
  "file_size": 1024000,
  "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
  "file_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "File size 6291456 bytes exceeds maximum allowed size of 5242880 bytes",
  "error_code": "FILE_UPLOAD_ERROR",
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```
