- **Retry Management**: Schemas for retry request and response handling

**Schema Features:**
- Email address validation using EmailStr
- Field length limits and validation
- Optional field handling with proper defaults
- Comprehensive error response structures

### 4. API Endpoints (`app/api/v1/endpoints/applications.py`)

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all export operations

**Endpoint Features:**
- Application status validation before export
- Email service integration with error handling
- Database transaction management
- Audit logging with IP and user agent tracking
- Retry mechanism integration

### 5. Email Retry Service (`app/services/email_retry_service.py`)
- **Background Worker**: Asynchronous retry processing
- **Exponential Backoff**: Configurable delay calculation with maximum limits
- **Retry Limits**: Maximum retry attempts with permanent failure handling
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive retry statistics and monitoring

**Retry Features:**
- Automatic background processing of failed exports
- Configurable retry policies (max retries, delays)
- Manual retry capability with force option
- Detailed retry statistics and monitoring

### 6. Exception Handling (`app/core/exceptions.py`)
- **EmailServiceException**: Specific exception for email service errors
- **Proper Error Codes**: Structured error codes for different failure types
- **HTTP Status Integration**: Appropriate HTTP status codes for different errors

### 7. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Complete test coverage for email service functionality
- **API Tests**: Endpoint testing with mocking and validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of email export workflow
- **Simple Tests**: Standalone tests for core functionality verification

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@formvault.com

# File Upload Configuration
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880  # 5MB
```

### Dependencies Added
- `jinja2==3.1.2` - Template engine for email generation
- `aiosmtplib==2.0.2` - Async SMTP client for email sending

## API Usage Examples

### Export Application
```bash
POST /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/export
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "recipient_email": "claims@insurance-company.com",
  "insurance_company": "ABC Insurance Corp",
  "additional_notes": "Please process this application urgently."
}
```

### Get Export History
```bash
GET /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/export-history
```

## Security Features

### Email Security
- SMTP authentication with secure credentials
- TLS encryption for email transmission
- Input validation and sanitization
- File attachment validation and security

### Data Protection
- Audit logging for all export operations
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Secure file handling with encrypted storage
- Rate limiting protection (inherited from existing middleware)

## Error Handling

### Email Service Errors
- SMTP connection failures with retry logic
- Authentication errors with clear messaging
- Template rendering errors with fallback content
- File attachment errors with graceful degradation

### API Error Responses
- 404: Application not found
- 422: Validation errors (invalid email, application status)
- 500: Email service failures
- Proper error codes and messages for debugging

## Monitoring and Logging

### Structured Logging
- Email send attempts and results
- Retry attempts with delay information
- Error details with stack traces
- Performance metrics for email operations

### Audit Trail
- Complete export history tracking
- User activity logging with IP addresses
- Status change tracking with timestamps
- Retry attempt logging with error details

## Performance Considerations

### Async Operations
- Non-blocking email sending
- Background retry processing
- Efficient database operations
- Proper connection management

### Resource Management
- Connection pooling for SMTP
- File handle management for attachments
- Memory efficient template rendering
- Configurable retry delays to prevent overload

## Testing Results

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Email service initialization and configuration
- ✅ Email template generation (HTML and text)
- ✅ File attachment handling
- ✅ SMTP sending with authentication
- ✅ Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- ✅ API endpoint validation and responses
